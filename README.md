# Emotify
### Tune in your emotion ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜Œ, tune out your playlist ðŸ“€
*An automated playlist generation from facial emotion.*

## Project Overview
As a team of four music enthusiast, this application was created to 
*recognize emotion from a face image and generate a befitting playlist based on the extracted emotion*. 

This project uses a **multimodal deep learning model** (or also known as a multimodal neural network) for facial analysis and emotion classification,
and a song selection function from our **DIY music databse with emotion score and labels** which calls on to the **Spotify web API** to generate the playlist and embedding.
